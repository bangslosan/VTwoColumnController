# Two column iOS UI

[Two Column UI](http://i.imgur.com/fscYS.png)

Personally I first saw this in the Pinterest app.

This is some example code I threw together to check out how this would work before adding
it into another app. Perhaps it can be made to be re-usable...

# Stuff this demo does

* Loads more when you reach the bottom
* Adds a custom view for each image you see with a shadow

# TODO

* Orientation/other device support
* Make this reusable via CocoaPods
* Other awesome stuff
